# Trout
An advanced UCI protocol chess engine using .NET Core and C#
⚠ Note: Trout is still a nascent project and the team is actively working out of this repository.
We will be periodically re-structuring the code to make it easier to comprehend, navigate, build,
test, and contribute to, so DO expect significant changes to code layout on a regular basis.
